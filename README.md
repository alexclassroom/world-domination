# World Domination

This plugin adds a summary of the current WordPress market coverage to your dashboard!

Basically screen scraping from the [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all "W3Techs") website (don’t panic W3Techs, I’m caching the data - your website performance is safe!), this will display what percentage of websites are currently powered by WordPress. 

Now you can keep an eye on how close to world (aka internet) domination WordPress is achieving <cue diabolical laughter>.
