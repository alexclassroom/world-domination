# World Domination

<img src="https://ps.w.org/world-domination/assets/icon-128x128.png" align="left">This plugin adds a summary of the current WordPress market coverage to your dashboard!

Basically screen scraping from the [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all "W3Techs") website (don’t panic W3Techs, I’m caching the data - your website performance is safe!), this will display what percentage of websites (in total or that use CRM) are currently powered by WordPress. There are even shortcodes so that you can this information into your posts as well!

Now you can keep an eye on how close to world (aka internet) domination WordPress is achieving <cue diabolical laughter>.

World Domination is a community plugin that follows both WordPress and WordPress VIP coding standards.
