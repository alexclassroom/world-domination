Add WordPress market coverage summary to your dashboard.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a summary of the current WordPress market coverage to your dashboard!

Basically screen scraping from the [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all "W3Techs") website (don’t panic W3Techs, I’m caching the data - your website performance is safe!), this will display what percentage of websites are currently powered by WordPress. 

Now you can keep an eye on how close to world (aka internet) domination WordPress is achieving <cue diabolical laughter>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Hey! My dashboard figure is different to the one shown on W3Techs =

For performance reasons I cache the dashboard information for one week so, if the market figure changes in the meantime, you will get this discrepancy. If you find this keeps happening, please let me know and I’ll look at refreshing the cache more regularly.
